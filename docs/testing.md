# Testing

Owner: MCLA-R maintainers

Purpose: define test layers, required evidence, regression routes, supported environments, and milestone-specific quality gates.

Current structural checks:

```powershell
ast-grep scan
ast-grep test --skip-snapshot-tests
```

Current rule fixtures cover unbounded `strcpy`, `sprintf`/`vsprintf`, and `strcat` calls.

Planned test layers:

1. host utility unit tests
2. ReXGlue/PPC tests when SDK code changes
3. structural analysis
4. startup smoke tests
5. frontend and first-race routes
6. save/load and soak tests
7. full campaign matrix
8. clean package tests

Update this document when any command, fixture, baseline, supported hardware configuration, canonical route, or closure gate changes.
